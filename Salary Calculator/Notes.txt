What if the user enters a start but not a finish date?
Can the user choose what day to display the pay for or it can only be the current day? besides the week and month display

Don't forget to take out the SkipBtn with its code!

What happens if the user works until after 12, when the day changes?

Will I need seperated xml files for weeks and months
